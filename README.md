# Electronic voting system
Designing the classes to allow voting:

The project includes classes, interfaces and functions such that it allows users to vote uniquely.
If any user votes twice, to different parties It reports the user as a blacklisted person and that person disqualifies for further voting. 
At last it would count these votes. And declare the winner.
It uses OOP concepts so that the design remains the same for all use cases.

[Demo App](https://github.com/nsahai8/electronic-voting-system/blob/master/src/main/java/com/demo/DemoApp.java) is given as an example.
